title: Redis Multicloud High Availability using Skupper
subtitle: Secure Redis servers across multiple distributed Kubernetes clusters
workflow: null
overview: |
  This example deploys a simple highly available Redis architecture with
  Sentinel across multiple Kubernetes clusters using Skupper.

  In addition to the Redis Server and Sentinel, the example contains
  an additional service:

  * A wiki-getter service that exposes an `/api/search?query=` endpoint. 
    The server returns the result from the Redis cache if present otherwise
    it will retrieve the query via the `wiki api` and cache the content via
    the Redis primary server.

  With Skupper, you can place the Redis primary server in one cluster and 
  the replica servers in alternative clusters without requiring that
  the servers be exposed to the public internet.

  - standard: kubernetes/set_up_your_kubernetes_cluster
  - standard: podman/set_up_your_podman_environment
  - title: Install the Skupper controller
    commands:
      "west":
        - run: kubectl apply -f https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper/releases/download/2.0.0-preview-2/skupper-setup-cluster-scope.yaml
  - title: Create your sites
    preamble: |
      A Skupper _site_ is a location where components of your
      application are running.  Sites are linked together to form a
      Skupper network for your application.

      Use the `kubectl apply` command to declaratively create sites
      in the kubernetes namespaces. This deploys the Skupper router. 
      Then use `kubectl get site` to see the outcome.

      **Note:** If you are using Minikube, you need to [start minikube
      tunnel][minikube-tunnel] before you run `kubectl apply`.

      [minikube-tunnel]: https://skupper.io/start/minikube.html#running-minikube-tunnel
    commands:
      west:
        - run: kubectl apply -f ./west-crs/site-west.yaml
        - run: kubectl wait --for condition=Ready --timeout=60s site/west
      east:
        - run: kubectl apply -f ./east-crs/site-east.yaml
        - run: kubectl wait --for condition=Ready --timeout=60s site/east
      north:
        - run: kubectl apply -f ./north-crs/site-north.yaml
        - run: kubectl wait --for condition=Ready --timeout=60s site/north
    postamble: |
      As you move through the steps below, you can use `kubectl get` at
      any time on a resource to check your progress.
  - title: Deploy Redis Server and Sentinel
    preamble: |
      A _yaml_ file defines the resources for the Redis deployment in each
      site. Each contains:

      - A Server deployment resource
      - A Sentinel deployment resource
      - A Redis config map for configuration

      ** Note ** the `redis-north.yaml` file designates the server to be
      primary while the other sites are designated as replica sites to north.
    commands: 
      west:
        - run: kubectl apply -f ./west-crs/redis-west.yaml
      east:
        - run: kubectl apply -f ./east-crs/redis-east.yaml
      north:
        - run: kubectl apply -f ./north-crs/redis-north.yaml
    postamble: |
      ** Note ** the Sentinel deployments in each site use an init container
      that waits for the service definitions of the Redis servers in all
      sites to exist before execution. This will be satisfied by the next
      step.
  - title: Expose Redis Server and Sentinel to Application Network
    preamble: |
      We will create links and connectors in the sites to expose the server and 
      sentinel deployments in each namespace
    commands: 
      west:
        - await_resource: deployment/redis-server
        - run: kubectl apply -f ./west-crs/listener-west.yaml
        - run: kubectl apply -f ./west-crs/connector-west.yaml        
      east:
        - await_resource: deployment/redis-server
        - run: kubectl apply -f ./east-crs/listener-east.yaml
        - run: kubectl apply -f ./east-crs/connector-east.yaml        
      north:
        - await_resource: deployment/redis-server
        - run: kubectl apply -f ./north-crs/listener-north.yaml
        - run: kubectl apply -f ./north-crs/connector-north.yaml
  - title: Create podman site resource definitions
    preamble: |
      A podman site will attach to the kubernetes west site to enable
      the redis cli to access the server and sentinel deployments. This
      will be enabled by defining a site resource and the collection of
      listener resources that will map host and ports onto the services
      provided on the kubernetes clusters.

      The resources will be input in the default namespace location
      for the current user:

      `~/.local/share/skupper/namespaces/default/input/sources/`
    commands:
      podman-west:
        - run: ./podman-crs/setup-resources.sh
  - title: Link your sites
    preamble: |
      A Skupper _link_ is a channel for communication between two sites.
      Links serve as a transport for application connections.

      Creating a link requires use of a `skupper token issue` command to generate
      an access token resource (with details and a secret token) and then activating
      the link via `skupper token redeem` in the appropriate namespaces.
    commands:
      west:
        - run: skupper token issue ~/link-to-west.yaml --redemptions-allowed 2
        - run: skupper token issue ~/.local/share/skupper/namespaces/default/input/sources/link-to-west.yaml
      east:
        - run: skupper token issue .~/link-to-east.yaml
        - run: skupper token redeem ~/link-to-west.yaml
      north:
        - run: skupper token redeem ~/link-to-west.yaml
        - run: skupper token redeem ~/link-to-east.yaml
  - title: Create Podman site
    preamble: |
      The skupper cli can be used to create a podman (non-kube) site
      that instatiates the set of resources in the
      `~/.local/share/skupper/namespaces/default/input/sources` directory.
    commands: 
      podman-west:
        - run: skupper system setup --path ~/.local/share/skupper/namespaces/default/input/sources
  - title: Use Redis command line interface to verify master status
    preamble: |
      Running the `redis-cli` from the podman-west site, attach to the Redis server
      and Sentinel to verfy that the redis-server-north is master.
    commands: 
      podman-west:
        - run: redis-cli -p 6379
        - run: 127.0.0.1:6379> ROLE
          output: |
            1) "master"
            2) (integer) 1531796
            3) 1) 1) "redis-server-west"
                  2) "6379"
                  3) "1531796"
               2) 1) "redis-server-east"
                  2) "6379"
                  3) "1531796"
        - run: 127.0.0.1:6379> exit
        - run: redis-cli -p 26379
        - run: 127.0.0.1:26379> sentinel get-master-addr-by-name redis-skupper
          output: |
           1) "redis-server-north"
           2) "6379"
        - run: 127.0.0.1:26379> exit
  - title: Deploy the wiki-getter service
    preamble: |
      We will choose the north namespace to create a wiki-getter deployment
      and service. The client in the service will determine the 
      Sentinel service to access the current Redis primary server
      for query and cache updates.
    commands:
      north:
        - run: kubectl apply -f wiki-getter.yaml
          output: |
            deployment.apps/wiki-getter created
            service/wiki-getter created
  - title: Get Wiki content
    preamble: |
      Use `curl` to send a request to querty the Wikipedia API via the 
      wiki-getter service. Note the *X-Response-Time* header for the initial
      query. The application will check the redis cache and if not found
      will fetch from the external Wikipedia API. If the content has been 
      stored, the applications will provide the response directly.
    commands:
      north:
        - run:  kubectl exec -it deployment/wiki-getter -- curl -f -I --head http://wiki-getter:8080/api/search?query=Boston
          output: |

            Keep-Alive: timeout=5
  - title: Force Sentinel failover
    preamble: |
      Using the Sentinel command, force a failover as if the master was not reachable. This
      will result in the promotion of one of the slave Redis servers to master role.
    commands:
      podman-west:
        - run: redis-cli -p 26379
        - run: 127.0.0.1:26379> sentinel failover redis-skupper
          output: |
            OK
            (0.66s)
        - run: 127.0.0.1:26379> sentinel get-master-addr-by-name redis-skupper
          output: |
            1) "redis-server-west"
            2) "6379"
        - run: 127.0.0.1:26379> exit
    postamble: |
      Note that `redis-server-east` may have alternatively been elected master role.
  - title: Verify Wiki content
    preamble: |
      Check that cached content is correctly returned from new master.
    commands:
      north:
        - run:  kubectl exec -it deployment/wiki-getter -- curl -f -I --head http://wiki-getter:8080/api/search?query=Boston
          output: |

  - title: Use Redis command line to measure latency of servers from each site
    preamble: |
      To understand latency in a true multicloud scenario, the redis-cli can be used to
      measure the latency of a Redis server in milliseconds from any application network
      site. 
    commands:
      west:
        - run: kubectl exec -it deployment/redis-server -- redis-cli --latency -h redis-server-west -p 6379 --raw
          output: |
            0 10 1.41 88
        - run: kubectl exec -it deployment/redis-server -- redis-cli --latency -h redis-server-east -p 6379 --raw
          output: |
            76 254 96.40 10
        - run: kubectl exec -it deployment/redis-server -- redis-cli --latency -h redis-server-north -p 6379 --raw
          output: |
            33 104 44.00 19
      east:

        - run: kubectl exec -it deployment/redis-server -- redis-cli --latency -h redis-server-east -p 6379 --raw
          output: |
            0 26 1.28 89
        - run: kubectl exec -it deployment/redis-server -- redis-cli --latency -h redis-server-north -p 6379 --raw
          output: |
            113 358 149.14 7
      north:
        - run: kubectl exec -it deployment/redis-server -- redis-cli --latency -h redis-server-west -p 6379 --raw
          output: |
            33 103 38.71 21

    postamble: |
      The sample period output is latency min, max, average over the number of samples. Note, that the sample
      outputs provided are actual measures across three public cloud locations (Washington DC, London, and Dallas)
  - title: Cleaning up
    preamble: |
      To remove Skupper and other resource from this exercise, use the
      following commands.
    commands:
      west:
        - run: kubectl delete ns west
      east:
        - run: kubectl delete ns east
      north: 
        - run: kubectl delete ns north
      podman-west:
        - run: skupper system teardown
summary: |
  This example locates the Redis Server and Sentinel services in different
  namespaces, on different clusters.  Ordinarily, this means that they
  have no way to communicate unless they are exposed to the public
  internet.

  Introducing Skupper into each namespace allows us to create a virtual
  application network that can connect Redis services in different clusters.
  Any service exposed on the application network is represented as a
  local service in all of the linked namespaces.

  The Redis primary server is located in `north`, but the Redis replica
  services in `west` and `east` can "see" it as if it were local.
  Redis replica operations take place by service name and Skupper
  forwards the requests to the namespace where the corresponding server
  is running and routes the response back appropriately.
